# A Python based Pomodoro Timer for MacOS.

Using mostly standard library in Python, this python code will notify you its time to take a break or anything else you want. It displays a MacOS style notification without using ObjectiveC libraries. 

Super simple 

:smile:

The code makes use of the (https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)[schedule] library by Dan Bader. It also demonstrates some 
simple Python concepts. Creating classes, subclassing, sepeating configuration from the actual code. And finally a simple logger is 
impleneted using a Python Decorator. Why did I code this, to practice and not forget these awesome concepts.
